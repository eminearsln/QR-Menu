# QR Menu Web Application

## About the Project

This project is a QR Menu Web Application developed to meet the digital menu needs of businesses such as restaurants, cafes, and ice cream shops. With its user-friendly interface, easy accessibility, and visually appealing design, it offers a modern experience to customers.

## Features

- The menu consists of 4 main categories: Ice Creams, Desserts, Cakes, and Drinks.
- Clicking on a category filters the products and displays only the relevant items.
- When a product is clicked, detailed information about the product (Category, Price) is displayed to the user.
- Product data is managed through a custom-built API and fetched using the JavaScript `fetch()` method.
- The API is completely developed by me.
- Responsive design for compatibility across all devices (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
- Modular JavaScript structure is used for better maintainability and scalability.
- HTML pages and JavaScript files are separated and structured modularly.
- Focused on delivering a smooth user experience supported by effective visuals and a clean design.
